* Connect to a database using Sequelize and environment variables.

* Create and configure a Sequelize model.

* Perform CRUD operations with Sequelize methods.

* Use validation tools on a Sequelize model.

* Encrypt a password using `bcrypt`.

* Automate functionality using Sequelize Hooks.

* Create and run a custom method on a Sequelize instance.

* Implement and know when to use different Sequelize associations for one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.
